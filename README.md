## Problem of the project
An always goto stop for all the needs - Supermarkets!

Although supermarkets house a lot of products coming from different product markets, the sales of all categories are not the same.

## How to know these categories?
Do these categories need to be replaced?
Is there any solution to improving sales and maximising profit?
This is where we will come in!

> Our app, “Hacked the Grocers Gap”, will provide some key insights of the supermarket identifying those product segments with less sales. On the basis of previous records, we will analyse and recommend the items to be retained or replaced in the supermarket to get the maximum profit considering quantity and margins.
